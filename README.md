# QKD
A secure communication platform using quantum key Distribution (QKD) to safe guard digital messages aganist quantum computing threats.
# Introduction
This project introduces a secure messaging platform leveraging Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to protect communications against quantum threats. Built with Python and integrated into a Flask/Django web app, it combines advanced cryptography with a user-friendly interface for quantum-resistant communication.
Exisiting cryptographic methods are at stake of not continuous improvement, due to the advancements in the quantum computing world. Here, in this project we proper a quantum resistant solution to secure online communications. 
The core functionalities of the project are:
- Quantum-resistant encryption using QKD protocols.
- Python-based implementation of cryptographic infrastructure.
- Web application with Flask and Django for a user-friendly interface.
- End-to-end secure messaging with advanced quantum-safe techniques.
# Objectives and Technical Overview
In order to create a secure messaging platform that uses Quantum Key Distribution QKD) to protect communications from threat. we built a python-based backend and integrating it with flask & Django. This paltform utilizes BB84 QKD protocol to exchange encryption kesy securely by leveraging quantum mechanics principles like superposition and measurement collapse. python deals with the cryptographic part, while flask and Django provide accessible web application. The way how this works, is by generating quantum keys and coding them into qubits using quantum gates. The generated qubits are transmitted through a secure channel, the reciver there measures and extracts a shared secret key. The QKD protocol is then integrated into the web application, enabling a secure way of encrypted communication.

# Installation,Tools and Usage.
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Install required libraries: pip install qiskit flask django numpy matplotlib.
- Qiskit, Flask/Django, Numpy, Matplotlib

# Testing
- Unit tests for QKD protocol components.
- End-to-end tests simulating secure communication

# Results
- Demonstrated secure messaging using QKD.
- Successfully defended against simulated quantum attacks.
- Key generation time: 60-bit keys in under 150ms.
