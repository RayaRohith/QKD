# QKD
A secure communication platform using quantum key Distribution (QKD) to safe guard digital messages aganist quantum computing threats.
# Introduction
This project introduces a secure messaging platform leveraging Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to protect communications against quantum threats. Built with Python and integrated into a Flask/Django web app, it combines advanced cryptography with a user-friendly interface for quantum-resistant communication.
Exisiting cryptographic methods are at stake of not continuous improvement, due to the advancements in the quantum computing world. Here, in this project we proper a quantum resistant solution to secure online communications. 
The core functionalities of the project are:
- Quantum-resistant encryption using QKD protocols.
- Python-based implementation of cryptographic infrastructure.
- Web application with Flask and Django for a user-friendly interface.
- End-to-end secure messaging with advanced quantum-safe techniques.
# Objectives and Technical Overview
In order to create a secure messaging platform that uses Quantum Key Distribution QKD) to protect communications from threat. we built a python-based backend and integrating it with flask & Django. This
